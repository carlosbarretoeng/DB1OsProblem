#DB1Os

This repository is destined to show a personal proposal to solve the "DB1 Operational System Problem" for 
application to the "PHP PlÃªno Developer" position.

The main goal is to locate a position in a bidimensional array and replace the element with another one following 
some rules.

I used the approach based on computer vision adjacent elements that find the central pixel, and then north, east, 
south, and west pixels. This technique is used in computer vision to filter image noises and homogenize colors in a 
picture.

### The code & How to run

I used a Docker-Compose file to create a development environment. To run the code, please, follow this steps:

> $ git clone
